1) twitter competition app.

d3 visualization of certain hash tag. 

- the user can create a competition, and poll decisions based on designated hashtags. 

- the graph would be adjusted in realtime, and there would be a live stream of tweets that contain the designated hashtags. 

can twitter update based on stream live. 
meteor subscribes to data..

3) surfline discussion based app. 
 - spitcast api.
 - d3 wave visualizations. 


 ok I have two new ideas that I am excited about..

1. Twitter Polling/Competition:
- user can specify polling paramaters: He or she would prompt a question. The choices would be in hashtag format. ex. #yes or #no.
- results would be in realtime displayed on a d3 or chart.js graph
- the user could also set starting and end times for the polling to occur.

2. Opinion based Surf-forecast
Currently the only surf forecasts are machine generated. 
- An application that enables users to comment about their experience using on the day compared to the data that api.spitcast.com provides.. 
- I would also want user to be able to upload photos of that day. 
- I have found the appropriate data for this project.. 


Currently I have my angular, meteor, and mongo set up. I am trying to make data from my api display on my view..
